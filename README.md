Description of the files

1. Data.txt: converted format of (a) arrival time dataset from the International Seismological Center (ISC) archives in the period from 1982 to 2024 for earthquakes with magnitude (mb) greater than or equal to 3.0, and (b) manual picks from waveforms that are downloaded from the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) online repository.    

2. Figures.doc: Supplementary figures referenced in the manuscript

3. Hainan_stn.txt, Hainan_data.txt, : Stations and Pn arrival times published by Lu et al. (2022) for Hainan Island. Original version is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5976028

4. Model_3D.txt: the P-wave model for the Malay Peninsula as well as S-wave, density, and Poisson's ratio derived using empirical relationships. 

5. Patameter_setting.inc: This file contains the settings of all parameters used in the inversion.

6. Residuals.txt: The residuals for the present study (RCAL) and those from ISC (REIN) are listed in columns 9 and 10, respectively, for corresponding events and arrivals. Travel-time residuals for SEISAN-located events are assigned an arrival ID of "20000001."

7. Stations.dat: a list of stations within the study area.

8. Vel_1D.dat: Global 1D velocity models including the ak135

9. The executable program to produce the P-wave model and other outputs.
